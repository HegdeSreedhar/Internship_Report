\section{Communication technologies in Automotive Domain}
It is important to note that the incorporation of Ethernet as an in-vehicle networking system does not imply that traditional communication networks such as CAN, LIN, and MOST are rendered obsolete. Because these networks are robust, inexpensive, time-tested, and provide necessary performance for many applications, Automotive Ethernet will not completely replace them, but will supplement them to provide even more cost, performance, and feature benefits. Table \ref{tab:Comparison_Automotive_Networks} shows the important characteristics of automotive networks in comparison with the Ethernet.

\section{Middleware technologies in automotive domain}
Briefly describe about the need and existing technologies. (SOME/IP, DDS)

\subsection{SOME/IP}
"`Scalable service Oriented MiddlewarE over IP"' abbreviated SOME/IP represents a middleware that was created for automotive use cases \cite{b1.1}. The compatibility with AUTOSAR was a necessity regarding SOME/IP at least on wire-format level \cite{b1.1}. SOME/IP communication is an exchange of messages between different devices like ECUs over IP \cite{b1.1}. There are more patterns available for basic SOME/IP communication \cite{b1.1}.
